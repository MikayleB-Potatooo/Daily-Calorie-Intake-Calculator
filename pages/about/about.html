		The daily calorie intake calculator app was developed by the developers using stackblitz. To use the calculator
		app, start first by clicking the calculator app tab found at the bottom of the page. Afterwards, you may now
		begin to input the necessary details and information needed to calculate your calorie intake such as gender,
		height in cm, weight in kg, age, and activity level. Once you have filled up the necessary details, you may now
		click on the calculate botton in order to view your needed daily calorie intake. Thank you
