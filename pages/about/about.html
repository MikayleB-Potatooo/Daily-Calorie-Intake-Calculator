		The daily calorie intake calculator app was developed by the developers using stackblitz. 
	</p>
  <h2>How does the daily calorie intake calculator work?</h2>
  <p>
    The calorie calculator is based on the Mifflin - St Jeor equation. It allows you to find your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) - the amount of energy needed for your body to support only its basic vital functions. It differs for men and women.
    <br/><br/>
    BMR(men) = 10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) – 5 * age(y) + 5
    <br/><br/>
    BMR(women) = 10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) – 5 * age(y) – 161
    <br/><br/>
    After you calculate your BMR, you need to multiply it by a factor corresponding to your physical activity level:
    <br/><br/>
    1. Sedentary lifestyle (little or no exercise): 1.2
    <br/><br/>
    2. Slightly active lifestyle (light exercise or sports 1-2 days/week): 1.4
    <br/><br/>
    3. Moderately active lifestyle (moderate exercise or sports 2-3 days/week): 1.6
    <br/><br/>
    4. Very active lifestyle (hard exercise or sports 4-5 days/week): 1.75
    <br/><br/>
    5. Extra active lifestyle (very hard exercise, physical job or sports 6-7 days/week): 2.0
    <br/><br/>
    6. Professional athlete: 2.3
