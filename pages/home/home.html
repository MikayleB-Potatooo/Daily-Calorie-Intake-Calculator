  <h3>What is a calorie intake?</h3>
  <p>
  Caloric intake is simply the number of calories an individual consumes on a daily basis. An individual can also determine their caloric intake on a weekly basis or any other defined timeline.

    The keys to losing weight are really quite simple and straightforward. In order for an individual to lose weight, they will have to reduce the number of calories they consume to a level below their Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). BMR refers to the average number of calories that a person's body burns on a daily basis.

    <p>
      Calories are defined as the amount of energy contained in the food that an individual consumes. Different types of food, by volume, have more calories than others. For example, foods that are high in fat and sugar are also typically higher in calories. Hence, if an individual consumes more calories than their body utilizes, the extra calories will be stored as excess body fat.
