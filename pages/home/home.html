  <h3>What is a calorie intake?</h3>
  <p>
  Caloric intake is simply the number of calories an individual consumes on a daily basis. An individual can also determine their caloric intake on a weekly basis or any other defined timeline.
  </p>
  <p>
    The keys to losing weight are really quite simple and straightforward. In order for an individual to lose weight, they will have to reduce the number of calories they consume to a level below their Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). BMR refers to the average number of calories that a person's body burns on a daily basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calories are defined as the amount of energy contained in the food that an individual consumes. Different types of food, by volume, have more calories than others. For example, foods that are high in fat and sugar are also typically higher in calories. Hence, if an individual consumes more calories than their body utilizes, the extra calories will be stored as excess body fat.

  <h4>Why do we need to count our daily calorie intake?</h4>
    <p>
     Many people are completely unaware of, or grossly underestimate their daily caloric intake. Counting calories can help raise an awareness of different types of foods, the number of calories they contain, and how these calories have a different effect on a person's feelings of satiety. Once a person has a better understanding of how many calories are actually in that bag of chips that they can so easily inhale within minutes, how much of their daily caloric intake it consumes, and how little the chips do to satiate their hunger, portion control and avoidance of foods with empty calories tends to become easier.
    </p>
     <p>
       Having actual caloric measurements can also assist in weight loss, since tangible calorie goals can be set, rather than simply trying to eat less. Also, although this is not necessarily directly related to calorie counting, studies have shown that portion control by simply eating from a smaller plate can help reduce calorie intake, since people tend to fill their plates and eat everything on their plates. Many people do not realize that they are overeating, since they have become accustomed to restaurant-sized portions being the norm, when said portions can be up to three or more times larger than necessary for a typical meal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tracking calories also puts exercise in a quantifiable perspective, increasing a person's awareness regarding how much exercise is really required to counteract a 220-calorie bag of M&M's. Once a link is made between the amount of exercise that some snack equates to, many people find abstaining from that bag of chips to be the preferred option rather than performing an equivalent amount of exercise â€“ which can lead to healthier eating habits.
